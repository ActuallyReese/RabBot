# Discord_Bot
 
## Functionality 
A simple Discord bot using the Hikari api. Currently it can:

- Respond to messages
  - Both at random (depends on the x variable) and in response to specific words
- React to messages at random (depends on the y variable)

The bot creates a random integer for both an x and y variable every time a message is made in a Discord channel. The random x integer is a number between 1 and 100, while the y integer is a number between 1 and 80, making the reaction messages more common.

## In the future
The bot will be able to upload gifs, respond to questions (using ai rather than predetermined responses), and enable the playing of minigames in servers.
